Task:
Machine Learning: Create predictive models to forecast city resource needs and detect anomalies in city operations.
#Abstract:
In the face of increasing urbanization, managing a city's resources and ensuring the safety and well-being of its citizens is a critical challenge. Our Smart City Management solution addresses this by integrating real-time data analytics, predictive modeling, and an interactive user interface to optimize resource consumption and identify anomalies. Utilizing time series datasets and the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model, our system fetches live data, predicts future trends in resource usage and crime rates, and provides city administrators with actionable insights. Regular database updates ensure prediction accuracy, aiding in proactive planning and intervention. This innovative approach enhances urban management, contributing to safer, more efficient, and sustainable cities.
